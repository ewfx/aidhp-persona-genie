## 💡 Inspiration
In today's complex financial landscape, choosing the right credit card can be overwhelming. Many people struggle to find cards that truly match their lifestyle and spending patterns. We noticed that:
- Users often select cards without understanding their full benefits
- Traditional recommendation systems lack personalization
